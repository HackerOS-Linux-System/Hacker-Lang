  Hacker Lang Projects (HLP) - Advanced Scripting Tool for HackerOS Linux system, inspired by Cargo.
license: MIT
crystal: ">= 1.0.0"

dependencies:
  http:
    github: crystal-lang/crystal
    version: "~> 1.0"  # Stdlib, but listed if needed for clarity; actually not required.
  yaml:
    github: crystal-lang/crystal
    version: "~> 1.0"  # Stdlib YAML.

# No external dependencies needed beyond stdlib for core functionality.
# For rich console output, we approximate with Crystal's Colorize and manual formatting.
# If you want fancier output, add a shard like 'tintin' or 'tablo' for tables.
# For example, to add tablo for tables:
#  tablo:
#    github: hutou/tablo
# But to keep it minimal, we use stdlib only.
